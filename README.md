# CityLink: Efficient Shortest Path Finder

CityLink is a program designed to efficiently find the shortest travel routes between cities in a network. It implements Dijkstra’s algorithm to compute the shortest path between the given source and the destination city.

## Overview
CityLink allows users to:
- Find the shortest path between the specified source and the destination city.
- Update the network of travel routes by adding or modifying links between cities.
- Clear the screen for better user experience
- Exit the program

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC).

### Installation
1. Download the zip file and then extract the contents.
2. Compile the source code using the C compiler: `gcc citylink.c -o citylink`

### Execution
1. Run the compiled executable: `./citylink`
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the number of cities, links between cities, source city, and destination city.
3. After computing the shortest path between the specified source and destination cities, you will be presented with a menu:
   - Enter ‘1’ to find the shortest path for other source and destination cities.
   - Enter ‘2’ to update the network of travel routes.
   - Enter ‘3’ to clear the screen.
   - Enter ‘4’ to exit the program.
4. Follow the prompts to perform the desired actions.
